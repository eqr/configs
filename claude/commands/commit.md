Explore the changes in uncommited git files in current repository. Write a good commit message. Always ask user to approve the message you have written. Carefully explore files before staging them, make sure the files need to be commited, not ignores. If you suspect that a changed file should be ignored, ask user for approval. Never write about yourself that the changes are coauthored by Claude.
NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER WRITE ANYTHING LIKE  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
